### Master Internships

- **Intenship project (_stage M2 ou stage de fin d'études_)**: _Accelerated and differentiable LISA space mission instrument response for fast parameter inference of gravitational waves._
    - Project details: [here](/assets/opportunities/2025_internship_stageM2_LISA.pdf)
    - Ideal start date: 1st April 2025  
    - Deadline to apply: 31st January 2025
    - Co-supervision: [Jean-Baptiste Bayle](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1881111)
    - Ideal duration: 5 or 6 months.
    - To apply, send an email to the supervisor with the application documents, a CV and your transcript of records (_relevé de notes_), with an email subject starting with [LISA-internship].


Prospective students interested in doing a Master's internship (M2) with me in our team should send an email to [tobiasliaudat@gmail.com](mailto:tobiasliaudat@gmail.com). The email should include a CV, and, if possible, a transcript of grades, and the research project of interest, which can be one of the proposed projects listed below (if any) or the topics the student is interested in that are aligned with our research (see [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/publications.md %}) or [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5YLM_sEAAAAJ)). If the student's expertise matches my research interests I will reply to discuss the posibilities of an internship. 

Projects will require a background in one or more of the following subjects: signal processing, machine learning, optimisation, and programming (Python).

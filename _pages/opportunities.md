### Master Internships


Prospective students interested in doing a Master's internship (M2) with me in our team should send an email to [tobiasliaudat@gmail.com](mailto:tobiasliaudat@gmail.com). The email should include a CV, and, if possible, a transcript of grades, and the research project of interest, which can be one of the proposed projects listed below (if any) or the topics the student is interested in that are aligned with our research (see [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/publications.md %}) or [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5YLM_sEAAAAJ)). If the student's expertise matches my research interests I will reply to discuss the posibilities of an internship. 

Projects will require a background in one or more of the following subjects: signal processing, machine learning, optimisation, and programming (Python).
